# 100 Days of GPU Challenge ðŸš€

Thanks to [Umar Jamil](https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu) for organizing this challenge!

Welcome to my journey through the 100 Days of GPU Challenge!Â  This repository documents my progress as I learn GPU programming from scratch, writing one CUDA kernel each day to explore different concepts and optimization techniques.

## Progress Log
