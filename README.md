# **100 Days of GPU Challenge** üöÄ  

Thanks to [Umar Jamil](https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu) for organizing this!  

## **Progress Log**  

### **Day 1**  
- Implemented a basic CUDA kernel to print *"Hello from GPU"*.  
- Explored and analyzed my GPU's specifications.  

### **Day 2**  
- Optimized **Vector Addition Acceleration** for a **10‚Å∏**-sized vector on RTX A4000.  
- Developed two CUDA kernels:  
  - **Multi-stream initialization acceleration** for efficient data loading.  
  - **Strided approach for vector addition** to optimize memory access.
