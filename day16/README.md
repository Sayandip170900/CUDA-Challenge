# Day 16: Revisiting Array Summation - Optimization with Shared Memory and Thread Coarsening, RTX A4000 Limit Testing

**Objective:**
- **Re-optimize Array Summation for RTX A4000:** Revisit the array summation problem from Day 5 and apply advanced optimization techniques, specifically targeting the limits and capabilities of an NVIDIA RTX A4000 GPU. This includes shared memory and thread coarsening to maximize performance on this architecture.
- **Hardware-Aware Optimization:** Optimize parameters like thread block size and thread coarsening factor based on RTX A4000 specifications (SM count, threads per SM/block, shared memory size) to achieve peak efficiency.
- **Shared Memory Reduction:** Implement an efficient parallel reduction using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and leverage faster on-chip memory.
- **Thread Coarsening for Reduction:** Integrate thread coarsening to further enhance the shared memory reduction, aiming to reduce thread overhead and improve data processing per thread.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Benchmark and compare the performance of a naive GPU reduction, a shared memory GPU reduction, and a shared memory reduction with thread coarsening against a CPU implementation, specifically analyzing performance on the RTX A4000.

**Hardware Limit Testing Context (RTX A4000):**
This optimization effort is specifically tuned considering the limits of an NVIDIA RTX A4000 GPU:
- **No. of SMs:** 48
- **Max. Threads per SM:** 2048
- **Max. Threads per Block:** 1024
- **Max. Shared Memory per SM:** 96KB (usable)
- **Max. Shared Memory per Block:** 48KB (when launching 1024 threads per block)

Based on these limits, we aim to maximize shared memory usage and thread parallelism:
- **Block Size (THREADS):** Set to 1024 to utilize maximum threads per block and blocks per SM.
- **Shared Memory per Block:**  48KB can store approximately 12,000 integers (4 bytes each).
- **Thread Coarsening Factor (ELEMENTS):** Calculated as `floor(12000 / 1024) â‰ˆ 11`.  We use `ELEMENTS = 11` for thread coarsening, aiming for each thread to process 11 elements to maximize shared memory efficiency while keeping within hardware limits.

**Key Learnings:**
- **RTX A4000 Specific Optimization:** Gained experience in tailoring GPU kernels to the specific architecture and limitations of a target GPU (RTX A4000). This involves understanding SM counts, thread limits, and memory capacities to optimize kernel launch parameters and resource usage.
- **Array Reduction Revisited and Hardware Tuning:** Applied the accumulated knowledge of GPU optimization techniques back to array summation, now with a focus on hardware-specific tuning for the RTX A4000.
- **Shared Memory for Efficient Reduction on RTX A4000:**  Confirmed the effectiveness of shared memory reduction for achieving high performance on the RTX A4000 by minimizing global memory traffic.
- **Thread Coarsening Benefits on RTX A4000:**  Demonstrated that thread coarsening further enhances shared memory reduction performance on the RTX A4000, likely by improving instruction throughput, reducing thread management overhead, and better utilizing shared memory bandwidth.
- **Performance Gains from Optimization:** Observed significant performance improvements across optimization levels, specifically on the RTX A4000 hardware: Naive -> Shared Memory -> Shared Memory + Thread Coarsening.

**Shared Memory and Thread Coarsened Reduction Kernel:**
```c
__global__ void sumReduceSharedCoarseGPU(int *arr, unsigned long long *sum)
{
    int base = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * ELEMENTS;
    int t_i = base + threadIdx.x;

    __shared__ int arr_s[THREADS];

    int sum_coarse = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < ELEMENTS; i++)
    {
        int index = t_i + i * blockDim.x;
        if (index < N)
            sum_coarse += arr[index];
    }

    arr_s[threadIdx.x] = sum_coarse;
    __syncthreads();

    for (int stride = blockDim.x / 2; stride >= 1; stride /= 2)
    {
        __syncthreads();
        if (threadIdx.x < stride)
        {
            arr_s[threadIdx.x] += arr_s[threadIdx.x + stride];
        }
    }

    if (threadIdx.x == 0)
    {
        atomicAdd(sum, (unsigned long long) arr_s[0]);
    }
}
